      p.hero Hi there, I'm Babs. A trained Lawyer who has done everything from Graphic Design to Media & Marketing to Heading Operations to B2B Sales - just about everything except practising Law. It's been quite a journey but every waypoint has brought its own unique experiences. Through it all, my passion for creating and coding has guided and brought me here... to Web Development. I am a Front-End Developer based in Lagos, Nigeria (go Lasgidi!). I am self-taught, always growing my skills and always looking to learn some new thing(s) every day.

      p.hero The tools of my trade. I am always working towards coding in the most efficient, semantic way using best practices for web development. In addition to these tools, I use front-end frameworks such as Boostrap and other responsive grid systems. I am also a huge fan of Jade and Sass! At the end of the day however, my main aim is ensuring that the interfaces I work on look amazing across all devices.
